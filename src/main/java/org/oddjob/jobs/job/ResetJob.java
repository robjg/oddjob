/**
 * @oddjob.description A job which resets another job. This job is 
 * useful to reset jobs or services that have been persisted, and
 * loaded back in their previous COMPLETE states. The reset 
 * can be used to set them back to READY.
 * <p>
 * A reset might also be needed before running a job elsewhere
 * such as on a remote server.
 * <p>
 * As of version 1.4 of Oddjob, this job can now also be used to force
 * jobs that are {@link Forceable} by specify 'force' as level.
 * <p>
 * This job is not Serializable and so won't be persisted
 * itself.
 * <p>
 * See also the {@link org.oddjob.state.Resets} job.
 *
 *
 * @oddjob.example 
 * 
 * Using reset in explorer.xml. 
 * <p>
 * Look at the explorer.xml file in Oddjob's home directory. This file is 
 * loaded by the default oddjob.xml file when Oddjob first runs.
 * The explorer.xml configuration is run with a {@link FilePersister} 
 * persister that persists the Explorers state when it 
 * completes. When Oddjob is run again the Explorer will be
 * loaded with it's previous COMPLETE state and so won't run. The reset
 * is necessary to set it back to READY. 
 *
 * @oddjob.example
 *
 * Force a job to complete.
