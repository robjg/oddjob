 * An interface for a client side proxy to implement so that a
 * remote object can be polled for log messages.
 * <p>
 * The idea of being able to poll is that a remote component
 * might be generating thousands of log message which would
 * flood the network if they arrived as notifications. Although
 * polling would miss messages it maintains performance and
 * the time you really want to see messages is when the remote
 * object crashes or hangs.
 * <p>
 * Polling provides an indication that a remote component is
 * working or what a potential problem might be.
